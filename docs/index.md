UNICORN is an event processing platform developed by Business Process Technology group at the Hasso-Plattner-Insitut. It provides services to capture real-world events from different sources, to process these events, e.g., by aggregation or transformation, to correlate the events to its corresponding business processes, and to provide and to manage these events for event consumers, e.g., business process monitoring applications.

UNICORN was developed for the EU Project GET Service that ended in 2015, in which event processing builds an important basis to provide enhanced logistics services for efficient and effective planning.
