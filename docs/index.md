UNICORN is an event processing platform developed by <a href="http://bpt.hpi.uni-potsdam.de">Business Process Technology group</a> at the [[http://hpi.de][Hasso-Plattner-Insitut]]. It provides services to capture real-world events from different sources, to process these events, e.g., by aggregation or transformation, to correlate the events to its corresponding business processes, and to provide and to manage these events for event consumers, e.g., business process monitoring applications. <!--Especially for the event correlation to the right business process and the distribution of the events to the responsible party of this business process, the platform not only stores event object types but also business process models and event queries. -->

UNICORN was developed for the EU Project <a href="http://getservice-project.eu">GET Service</a> that ended in 2015, in which event processing builds an important basis to provide enhanced logistics services for efficient and effective planning.

<!--Business process monitoring enables a fast and specific overview of the process executions in an enterprise. Traditionally, this kind of monitoring requires a coherent event log.
Yet, in reality, execution information is often heterogeneous and distributed. In our paper "Monitoring of Business Processes with Complex Event Processing", we present an approach that enables monitoring of business processes with execution data, independently of the structure and source of the event information. We achieve this by implementing an open source event processing platform combining existing techniques 
from complex event processing and business process management. Event processing includes transformation for abstraction as well as correlation to process instances and BPMN elements. Monitoring rules are automatically created from BPMN models and executed by the platform.-->
